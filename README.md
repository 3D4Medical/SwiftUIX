# About

A collection of useful SwiftUI components and tools.

## Components

### `Checkbox`

A simple checkbox control. Its API mimics that of `Toggle`.

### `PresentationLink2`

A revival of `PresentationLink` and a replacement for the buggy `View.sheet` (as of Xcode 11 beta 4). `View.sheet` seems to function abnormally whilst embedded in a `NavigationView`.

## Installation

1. In Xcode, open your project and navigate to **File** → **Swift Packages** → **Add Package Dependency...**
2. Paste the repository URL (`https://github.com/swiftuix/SwiftUIX`)
